# Codebreaker Solitaire Service

This project implements a REST service that provides a solitaire version of _Codebreaker_, a simple game-breaking game, similar to _Mastermind_ and the pencil-and-paper game _Bulls and Cows_. This project is used in the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com/) Java training programs.

For more information, see the live service documentation at <https://ddc-java.services/codebreaker>.
