[[overview_http_verbs]]
== What is _Codebreaker_?

_Codebreaker_ is a simple RESTful service that permits consumers of the service to present and play a deductive logic game, where the goal is to guess a secret code generated (at random) by the service.

In the current implementation,

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET` | Used to retrieve a resource (`Code` or `Guess`), or a collection of resources.

| `POST` | Used to create a new resource.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing `Code` resource, along with all of the related guesses.
|===

[[overview_http_status_codes]]
== HTTP status codes

Codebreaker adheres as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully.

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header.

| `204 No Content`
| The deletion of the specified resource was completed successfully.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. In most cases, the response body will provide additional details.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource does not exist.

| `409 Conflict`
| The requested resource did not exist

|===

[[overview_errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a note will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:
