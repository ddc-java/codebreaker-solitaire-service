[[codebreaker_overview]]
== What is _Codebreaker_?

_Codebreaker_ is a simple game of deductive reasoning---a more generalized variant of the board game _Mastermind_ and the earlier pencil-and-paper game _Bulls and Cows_---implemented as a RESTful service that permits clients (consumers of the service) to present the game to users for play.

[[play_overview]]
== Rules of play

=== Players

There are 2 roles in the game: _codemaker_ and _codebreaker_. In the pencil-and-paper and board game variants, players typically alternate playing these roles; in this variant, the service is always the codemaker, and the client is always the codebreaker. Thus, in its current implementation, this is a solitaire game: a client application requests generation of a code from the service, and then submits the user's guesses to the service, one at a time, displaying the response to the user.

=== Sequence of play

==== Start a new game

A game begins when the codebreaker requests that a new code be generated, with the code length and pool of characters specified in the request.

See <<post_code_endpoint,`POST /codebreaker/codes`>> for details on requesting the generation of new code (thus starting a new game) from this service.

==== Guessing the code

The objective of the codebreaker in the game is to guess a secret code (generated randomly by the codemaker, within parameters agreed on by both players), in as few guesses as possible.

Each guess consists of a string of characters (which must be of the same length as the code---that is, the length specified when starting the game). When a guess is submitted, the response from the codemaker consists (primarily) of 2 numbers:

* *Exact matches*
+
The number of characters in the code that are matched _exactly_ by the characters in the corresponding positions of the guess.

* *Near matches*
+
The number of characters in the code that are not matched _exactly_ by the guess, but that are matched by characters in the guess in non-corresponding positions.

The codebreaker would then use this information to refine each subsequent guess.

See <<post_guess_endpoint,`POST /codebreaker/codes/{codeId}/guesses`>> for details on submitting a guess to this service, and the information returned by the service.

==== End of play

The game ends when the codebreaker successfully guesses the code.
