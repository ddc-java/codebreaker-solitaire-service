== What is _Codebreaker_?

_Codebreaker_ is a simple game of deductive reasoning---a more generalized variant of the board game _Mastermind_ and the earlier pencil-and-paper game _Bulls and Cows_---implemented as a RESTful service that permits clients (consumers of the service) to present the game to users for play.

[[play_overview]]
== Rules of play

These are the rules of play for a generalized form of _Bulls and Cows_, stated in a form suitable for playing with pencil and paper.

=== Players

There are 2 roles in the game: _codemaker_ and _codebreaker_. In the pencil-and-paper and board game variants, players typically alternate playing these roles.

=== Sequence of play

==== _Codemaker_: Create the code

To play the game, the codemaker and codebreaker first agree on a code length and pool of characters.

Next, the codemaker generates the code, using only characters in the pool (any given character in the pool may be used more than once), and keeps it secret.

==== _Codebreaker_: Crack the code

The objective of the codebreaker in the game is to learn the secret code created by the codemaker, using as few guesses as possible.

===== _Codebreaker_: Make a guess

Each guess consists of a string of characters, with length equal to that of the code, and made up only of characters found in the pool used when creating the code.

===== _Codebreaker_: Evaluate the guess

When a guess is submitted, the codemaker compares it to the code, and responds to the codebreaker with 2 numbers:

* *Exact matches*
+
The number of characters in the code that are matched _exactly_ by the characters in the corresponding positions of the guess.

* *Near matches*
+
The number of characters in the code that aren't matched _exactly_ by the corresponding characters in the guess, but are matched by characters in the guess in non-corresponding positions.

Any character, in either the code or the guess, can only be used once when counting matches. That is, a corresponding pair of characters in the code and guess that form an exact match can't be used in any near matches, and any character used in one near match can't be used in any others.

===== _Codebreaker_: Refine the guess

Using the codemaker's response to the most recent guess, along with responses to any previous guesses (if any), the codebreaker refines the guess---after which the codemaker evaluates the new guess and tells the codebreaker the counts of exact and near matches, the codebreaker refines the guess, and so on.

==== End of play

A single game ends when the codebreaker successfully guesses the code.

Typically players will play multiple games, alternating roles, and keeping a tally of the total number of guesses for each player. After an agreed-upon number of games, the player with the lowest guess tally wins.

=== Example game

==== Creating the code

. The codemaker and codebreaker agree on a pool of characters of "A", "B", "C", and "D", with a code length of 3.

. The codemaker creates (randomly or otherwise) a secret code---a sequence of 3 characters, all of which must be in the pool. In this case, assume the generated secret code is "BDC".

==== Cracking the code

. For the first attempt, the codebreaker (in this example) guesses "AAA".

. Since none of the characters in the guess match (exactly or nearly) characters in the code, the codemaker tells the codebreaker that there are 0 exact matches and 0 near matches.

. The codebreaker now knows that the code contains no "A" characters, and guesses "BBB" for the next attempt.

. The codemaker responds that the guess has 1 exact match (the "B" in the first position of the guess matches the "B" in the first position of the code), and 0 near matches. (Note that the codemaker only reports the counts, not the specific characters or positions that were included in the counts.)

. The codebreaker knows that the code contains exactly 1 "B", and chooses "BCC" for the next guess.

. This time, the codemaker counts 2 exact matches (the "B" in the first position and the "C" in the third position) and 0 near matches.

. The codebreaker knows from the previous guess that 1 of the matches is "B"; since there are only exact matches in the current guess, the first character of the code must be "B". The code also contains exactly 1 "C", but it might be in the second or third position. Taking a chance, the codebreaker guesses "BCD".

. Neither the "C" nor the "D" in the guess match the code exactly, but both count as near matches. So the codemaker reports 1 exact match ("B" in the first position) and 2 near matches ("C" and "D").

. The codebreaker has figured it out now: Since the "B" in the first position is an exact match (deduced in steps 5 & 7), and there are 2 near matches, the "C" and "D" have to be swapped, for a guess of "BDC".

. The codemaker examines the guess and sees that all 3 characters match the code exactly. With 3 exact matches after 5 guesses, the code has been guessed correctly, so the game is over.

== Service

=== Overview

The Codebreaker Solitaire service acts as the codemaker, with endpoints allowing a client (in the codebreaker role) to start, retrieve, and delete games, and to submit and retrieve guesses.

Since the service is _always_ the codemaker, and since the service provides no capabilities to compare a given codebreaker's performance against that of any other codebreaker using the service, it is best suited to solitaire play: A client application would make requests of the service to start games and submit guesses on behalf of a user; an indefinite number of games could be played in this fashion, presumably with the aim of improving the user's deductive reasoning skills.

=== Basic specifications

* The service does not require authentication or an API key.

* All requests that include body content are expected to send that content as JSON, accompanied by the `Content-type: application/json` header.

* If the request includes an `Accept` header, it must include `application/json`, `application/*`, or `*/*` in the list of acceptable content types.

* All non-empty response bodies returned by the service are also JSON, also with the `Content-type: application/json` header.

* Every 24 hours, inactive games are removed from the database. An inactive game is defined as one which has had no guesses submitted in the last 14 days.
